CO2 Monitoring with a Rasperry Pi

This projects aims to monitor the CO2-level of a room and displays it on a RGB-LED. In addition to that, if the CO2-level of the room is higher than healthy for people, a buzzer starts to beep in order to warn the people in that room.

In times of covid, this application finds use in schools and other buildings where many people are gathered in one room together.
That is due to the fact that a low CO2-level is also signalising a low level of aersol. The beep of the buzzer reminds to ventilate the room.

In addition to the CO2-level measurement, this application also measures the humidity and the temperature of the room. Those measurements are uploaded to an online database so the behaviour of the room can be monitored.
